A guide of mostly food and food-adjacent recommendations in London. Probably not recommended for tourists as I've skipped a lot of places that although I personally wouldn't recommend, they must be visited at least once (yes Leicester Square I am looking at you).
I'll be structuring it out in terms of boroughs/areas, so that you can make a day out of most of them.


### Neighbourhoods

#### Islington

##### Kings Cross
Kings Cross and Coal Drops Yard I'm probably most biased about. There's green spaces, right by the canal, and with amazing food options.

In Coal Drops Yard I'd recommend for food (and probably in the order I'd recommend):
- Coal Office (really good dishes with flavour profiles that are maybe a bit less common)
- Barrafina (amazing Spanish food, and this is coming from a Spaniard, so you better believe it) and its sister restaurant Parrillan
- Canopy Market (Friday - Sunday) has a great food vendor selection. The oyster stall has always different varieties and the Frenchie has unarguably the best (duck) burger in the UK.
- Caravan (good coffee, good pizzas)
- Dishoom
- Beer + Burger (ok burgers, impressive beer selection)

Outside of Coal Drops, I love visiting the British Library, and Roti King or Dim Sum Duck are great lunch spots.

##### Angel
Upper Street between Highbury and Angel is a very nice walk, I'd recommend either direction. The high street is full of the usual shops, but there is plenty of semi-independent and independent stores and restaurants:

Grocery & Cookshops:
- Season
- Borough Kitchen
- Superette
- Avo???? (really good produce and some Spanish staples)
- Moxon's Fishmongers
- Camden Passage is full of little grocers

Restaurants:
- Black Axe Mangal (one of my favourites, always really interesting menu)
- The Compton Arms (has chef residencies)
- MeatLiquor (good burgers)
- Tofu Vegan (I haven't been but apparently really good)

Closer to Angel station, you'll find Camden Passage which is a beautiful street full of little local shops. From there, the walk east from the canal is very green, and you might be lucky enough to end up at Towpath for brunch (beware of queues).

##### Stoke Newington
Stoke Newington's main attraction (in my opinion), is Church Street (confirm name). Semi-pedestrianised, it is a lovely street to spend a morning walking through. It's full of stores so make sure you leave plenty of time to browse.

On the way to or back from Stoke Newington, I'd recommend stopping at (?). Here you'll find Jolene (amazing pastries, somehow even better for dinner) and three little local shops for great produce (Stella's (butcher which doubles as a listening bar), Oeno Maris (maybe a bit overpriced), and ???).

Further away, in Finsbury Park you can also find Four Legs, a pub that somehow had the best burger and best ravioli I'd ever had.

#### Camden
Don't.


#### East

##### Hackney
In my opinion, Hackney's main appeal is Broadway Market Street (both on market and non-market days) and London Fields at its end. Only drawback of Broadway Market is that it has too many solid coffee options - how will you ever choose?
The east side of London Fields has Netil Market, with really good market stalls and a rooftop bar.
The top (north) side of the park poses yet another decision: head west and stop at The Spurstowe Arms for a pint and a burger and then Violet Cakes for a coffee and a cupcake (elite diet if you ask me), or head east to Hackney ??? for a burger at Lagom (currently my favourite beef burger in London).
Hackney Central (check) also homes the Dusty Knuckle and its delicious focaccia.
If it's a Saturday (check???) and you have plenty of time, I'd recommend starting your day in Columbia Road for the weekly Flower Market. 

#### Central

##### Bloomsbury
I'm actually not sure if any of these are actually in Bloomsbury, but take this as the "central-London-but-not-really" section:
- Exmouth Market (Noble Rot Lambs Conduit)
- Sessions Arts Club
- St. John Restaurant
- The beautifully brutalist Barbican Estate and its Conservatory (requries tickets and can be hard to book, they also do architecture tours a few times a week)

#### South
I don't tend to head south, but when I do, you'll find me at one of the below:
- Battersea Power Station (newly restored old Power Station, with great food options (Arcade Food Hall, Solis, and Roti King))
- Borough Market (Coffee at Monmouth, Sandiwch at The Black Pig, Tacos from Tacos Padre and Crumble from Humble Crumble)
- Spa Terminus (distribution area for a lot of local places, they open to the public on Saturdays so you can find great ingredients straight from the source)
- Bermondsey Street (another lovely high street, with a few restaurants and a free-entry gallery)

#### Others

##### Museums
- V&A
- the Design Museum
- Tate Modern
- 180 Studios

##### Activities
- Canal boat from Paddington/Little Venice to Camden (or viceversa)
- "Free" walking tour (a tip is expected at the end)
- The Browser Walking Tours
- Theatre (my favourite being the National Theatre)
- Barbican Architecture Tour
- Open Spaces (check??) Walking Tours
