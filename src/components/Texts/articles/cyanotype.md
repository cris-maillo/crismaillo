I recently bought a Sun Printing kit which includes the pre-prepared paper and an acrylic sheet as a weight. I have been loving art kits as they are always a quick and easy way to find a creative interest (creative in the sense of creating, not necessarily in originality) and especially away from screens. 
<br><br>
The sunprints I have created look lovely on my walls but what I have most enjoyed is researching the medium and mimicking what cyanotype artists have and are creating. 
<br><br>
One thing that surprised me at first was realizing that cyanotype is a somewhat ‘inflexible’ art technique. Firstly, for most prints, cyanotype usually requires contact printing at a 1:1 ratio (in terms of size of the material compared to the print), and secondly, the “original” subjects are often either photographic negatives or small trinkets or organic materials as they can provide an interesting shape or have a certain degree of transparencies. 
<br><br>
Therefore, one would assume that the scope of what can be achieved with cyanotypes is quite limited. Nonetheless, when I started looking at sunprint artworks, I was surprised that this limit has somehow unlocked a new level of creativity in the artists:

- <a href="https://631710.cargo.site/" target="_blank">Soundwaves</a>
- <a href="https://www.ingalisamiddleton.com/#/phytoplankton-1/" target="_blank">Unicellular Organisms</a>

Which is why I maintained a focus on researching & <a href="https://www.are.na/cris-maillo/sunprints" target="_blank">collecting</a> any examples I was inspired by.

#### Creating
I do not intend to become or even attempt to become an artist. But I am keen on growing a sensibility to art and artists and those or that which inspires them. I could go on and on about my feelings towards creating (not just when it comes to art, but the cultivation of a creative practice in any area of life), but there are two thought streams that probably define these feelings the most:
<br><br>
Firstly, a desire to understand the true difficulty of doing art. I’ve always thought that it is easy to dismiss skill and talent as an audience member. This is mostly due to all the: ‘My Five-Year-Old Could’ve Made That’ -ers when it comes to, usually Modern, art. Even Generative Art (opinions on the ethics/morality of it aside) requires skill and time to finetune prompts to create a truly desired output. 
<br><br>
And secondly, the feeling of wanting to be good at everything and the sometimes-defeating feeling of not being able to be so. Yes, you definitely can do anything you set your mind to, but should you?
<br><br>
Anyway, I'll leave you with the sun print of my own creation that I'm most happy with; a still-life of all the jewellery I've been gifted by my mother:
